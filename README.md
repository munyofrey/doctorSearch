# BetterDoctor Search page

## Getting started

In order to successfully get responses from the BetterDoctor API you
will need to create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your API user key.

Your `.env` file should look like this

```text
DOCTOR_KEY=ba74c7c89d3fcf50275ed6570bc66aaa

```

navigate into the project directory and run

```shell
$ npm install
$ webpack
$ npm start
```
